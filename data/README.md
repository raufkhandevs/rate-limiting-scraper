# Proxy Data

This directory contains proxy data for the rate-limiting scraper application.

## Getting Proxy List

To update the proxy list:

1. Visit [https://free-proxy-list.net/en/](https://free-proxy-list.net/en/)
2. Scroll down to the "Free Proxy List" table
3. Click the document icon (ðŸ“„) above the table to download the raw list
4. Copy the proxy data from the downloaded file
5. Paste it into `proxies.txt` in this directory
6. **Important**: Remove any extra text, headers, or formatting - the file should only contain proxy entries in the format `ip:port`

## File Format

The `proxies.txt` file should contain one proxy per line in the format:

```
ip:port
```

### Example:

```
65.108.251.40:53535
123.141.181.24:5031
47.252.29.28:11222
67.43.236.21:4653
```

## Notes

- The proxy list is updated every 10 minutes on free-proxy-list.net
- Only include valid `ip:port` entries
- Comments (lines starting with `#`) are supported and will be ignored
- Empty lines are ignored
- The application will automatically detect HTTP/HTTPS protocol based on port 443

## Usage

The proxy parser utility (`src/utils/proxy-parser.ts`) will automatically:

- Parse the proxy list from this file
- Validate IP addresses and port numbers
- Filter out invalid entries
- Determine protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) based on port
